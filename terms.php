                           <p>By utilizing this website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. This is a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you and Laxiom Ltd, or any of its affiliated entities ("Laxiom") for use of the website, data, Laxiom electronic investment platform, and products and services which you selected or initiated, which may include the Laxiom investment platform and third party affiliates ("Products and Services").</p>

                            <h2>Laxiom Platform</h2>

                            <p>The Laxiom investment platform is an investment system. The Laxiom platform trades for investors.</p>
                            

                            <h2>Risk of Loss</h2>
                            
                            <p>The risk of loss in trading the financial market can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such investment is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. Before deciding to invest, you should carefully consider your objectives, level of risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.


By viewing this website and investing on the Laxiom trading platform, you fully understand and agree that the markets are subject to numerous implicit and explicit risks, none of which Laxiom can control or influence. You therefore acknowledge and agree that all investment is solely at your own risk.


You also agree to bear complete responsibility for your choice of your investment packages and acknowledge that Laxiom has not and will not make any specific recommendations to you upon which you are entitled to rely. You also understand that the information disseminated on this website represents impersonal, disinterested opinions and commentary of Laxiom and its employees and agents, but that the information does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to invest on any specific package.


The actual percentage gains/losses experienced by investors will vary depending on many factors, including, but not limited to: starting account balances, market behavior, the investor’s account settings, and the performance of the account managers. Because of this, actual percentage gains/losses experienced by investors may be materially different than the percentage gains/losses as presented on this website.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS.<i></p>
